| Returns a note if anagrams are not palindromes | "ruby" "bury" | "These words are anagrams but the first word is not a palindrome" |
| Returns a note if anagrams are indeed palindromes | "hannah" "nnaahh" | "These words are anagrams and the first word is also a palindrome!"))

## Known Bugs

Program thinks that (i.e.) "ruby" and "uuuu" are anagrams. Attempted requiring a condition of '&& (word1.join.squeeze.length == anaCheck.join.squeeze.length)' and other iterations with '.chars' but I couldn't get it to work. Does not successfully filter for repeat characters. If you find any other issues, please contact me at benjarwilliams at gmail dot com.
